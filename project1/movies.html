        <h2>Misogyny Without a Cause</h2>
        <p>
            The title of the film <i>Rebel Without a Cause</i> is a kind of a challenge. Before watching, one would think “Surely there must be a cause.” But the film delivers on its promise: despite Jim appearing as a more-or-less likeable and sympathetic character, it is hard to discern why he behaves the way he does. In this entry, I’d like to explore one possible “cause” for his rebellion: Misogyny
        </p>
        <p>
            1950s culture acknowledged just one type of successful family: a knowledgeable, dominant man married to a caring, subservient wife, and surrounded by a gaggle of bright, respectful kids. Rebel Without a Cause is one of the first movies in American cinema to even portray the possibility that a family could be anything different. Far from undermining this monolith, it worked to reinforce the need for this kind of family
        </p>
        <p>
            Jim’s family is not a happy one. His father, though forced by society to be the head of the family, is not prone to dominance. He doesn’t punish his wife for disagreeing with him in public, and he helps clean around the house. For her part, his mother often asserts her opinion over his and badgers him to get her way.
        </p>
        <p>
            In the present day, we can recognize the sources of some of these problems: Mrs. Stark, lacking the ability to meaningfully act on the world around her, resorts to nagging her husband to have agency. Mr. Stark, who could otherwise just have been a caring and accommodating partner, has to tolerate this ‘insubordination’ and appear weak and helpless. These people likely got married just because that’s what people did, rather than out of some deep emotional connection.
        </p>
        <p>
            Jim doesn’t—and can’t—see this as the real source of the problem. In the culture where he lives, the correlation between “Father doesn’t dominate Mother” and “Unhappy family” is impossible not to draw. In the police station, Jim laments that “If [my father] had the guts to knock mom cold once, then maybe she’d be happy and then she’d stop picking on him.” To us, this sounds barbaric and cruel, but in the false dichotomy he has in his mind, it is the necessary choice to make his family a happy one.
        </p>
        <p>
            The film continues with this theme: After the chickie run, he comes home distressed, and wants to turn himself in to the police. His mother confronts him and tells him not to. When she says “A foolish decision now could end your whole life, in ten years you’ll never know this even happened” his response is “Dad, answer her.” He came to his family for advice, and he doesn’t care whether it’s right because it came from his mother. Again, Mr. Stark is shown as weak for not ‘putting his wife in her place.’
        </p>
        <p>
            The absence of the cultural script for heterosexuality from his home life leads Jim to overvalue the notion of being a tough guy. He has a knife fight and then drives a car off a cliff to win a girl, and presumably their life after the end of the movie involves the type of male domination Jim lacks at home.
        </p>
        <p>
            To conclude, although this movie is seen as an embodiment of teen angst in the 1950s, a closer reading shows that Jim’s rebellion has more to do with his fragile masculinity than any overarching idea about disobeying parents or making an identity for yourself

        <h2>Is body snatching good? The FBI informs you the answer is no</h2>
        <p>
            The film Invasion of the Body Snatchers is framed by a prologue and epilogue showing Dr. Bennell talking to a psychiatrist, Dr. Hill. The majority of the runtime is Bennell recounting the events of the previous days to this doctor. In the epilogue scene, a truck is found crashed with the seed pods everywhere, and the psychiatrist finally believes Bennell and the movie ends with him panting in relief as the FBI is called to address the situation.
        </p>
        <p>
            It has been said by the producers and director that this was not their original vision, and I believe this framing undercuts a large portion of the significance of the movie.
        </p>
        <p>
            The movie is about the attractive nature of the seed pods. Post-transformation, people are not raving zombies, frantically trying to spread their contagion. They are genuinely content. When Bennell is trapped in a hotel, with no chance of escape, he is still treated kindly. Dr. Kaufmann expresses a sincere belief that the ability of the pods to solve the problems of their victims is worth the loss in autonomy. His desire to be left alone in his last hour of consciousness is respected. The way the narration talks about the pod people is in stark contrast to their actual portrayal on screen. Bennell says “A moment’s sleep and the girl I loved was an inhuman enemy, bent on my destruction,” but we see no such motives on screen. The audience is allowed to wonder why he is putting up such a fight when it would be so much easier and less problematic to just let the snatching happen to you. The emotional climax of the movie is a scene where Miles and Becky justify to themselves that the joy of love and wonder are worth all of the problems. They have to deal with the internal conflict of knowing they are choosing the side of pain and trauma because the wonders of life are worth the effort.
        </p>
        <p>
            In the original formulation, this was the theme. Miles had made the journey of self-discovery and sacrifice to decide he wanted to be an individual, only to find that the rest of the world did not care. Conformity was the simpler course of action. Although a grim ending, it shows the audience that since we can all relate to Miles’s desire for individuality, it is still in our hands to build such a society
        </p>
        <p>
            By changing the ending so Miles just turns the responsibility over to the proper authority, the movie completely undermines this message. In the real world, hierarchical power structures are the source of conformity, but in this movie, they are shown as liberatory. The rest of the nation does not need to consider what causes them to value the life they live in the way that they do, because the institution came in and prevented the spread of the dissent
