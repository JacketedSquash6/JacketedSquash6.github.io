        <h2>Invisible Woman: Feminism and Sexuality in <i>Invisible Man</i></h2>
        <p>
            One of the most interesting characters in Invisible Man to me is Sybil. She appears in only a single scene, and has no large effect on the plot, but her characterization (especially compared to the other sexualized white women in the book) is surprisingly deep.
        </p>
        <p>
            On first glance, she appears no different from the other nameless white woman that the protagonist gets into bed with. Both seem to want him only as a sexual object and Sybil, if anything, is worse due to her desire not just for sex, but specifically to be raped. However, consider the way she talks about the protagonist in relation to herself: When asked about why she would tell him about such a taboo desire, she replies “Oh, I know that I can trust you. I just knew you'd understand; you're not like other men. We're kind of alike.” and later continues “you are [so sensitive], and I feel so free with you. You've no idea.” (p. 520). One does not get the sense that she views him only as a sexually aggressive black man, but as a tender bedmate and partner with whom she can entrust a secret desire. The protagonist’s comment that she thinks he is a “domesticated rapist” (p. 521), while it may fit our preconceptions of her motives, doesn’t really fit with what she says or does.
        </p>
        <p>
            Instead, I think Sybil is better read as a commentary on women’s and sexual liberation. Due to her condition as the wife of an important man, she has little autonomy or adventure in her life. She says on page 521 that “I get so tired of living the way I do, […] Soon I’ll be old and nothing will’ve happened to me. […] [my husband] talks a lot about women’s rights, but what does he know about what a woman needs?” She feels that although her husband has an orthodox doctrine on women’s rights, he does not care about her wants or needs as an individual. Having no other outlet for the lack of meaning in her patriarchally-dominated life, she pursues sex as an escape. Her taboo desires are not born out of a racist view of black men, but because (in her words) “Men have repressed [women] too much. We’re expected to pass up too many human things” (519). Her inability to have her needs met inside of her marriage causes her to develop potentially unhealthy and inflated desires. This, however, does not correlate to a dehumanizing view of the protagonist. After he tricks her into believing he had done what she asked, she is giddy and grateful; happy that she has found someone who (she thinks) sees her, wants her, and content to have some control over her sexuality. This happiness is cut short, however. The protagonist realizes she cannot help him with his political him by the riot to abandon her forever.

            By the end of the book the protagonist has recognized his invisibility and decided to make the most of it, however, this 
            does not make him enlightened. Sybil is as invisible to him as he is to Jack or any of the others. Her interests and 
            desires are not comprehended but stereotyped. Her identity is not that of an equal but that of a pitiable whore. I don’t 
            know whether Ellison intended his work to have any feminist reading, but to me, this scene serves to remind us that nobody 
            can see everything. Even as the protagonist can comprehend several axes of oppression, he is still blind to others, in 
            this case gender and sexuality. To get back at <i>white</i> people for using dispossessed and desperate <i>black</i> people 
            as a political tool, the protagonist, a <i>man</i>, uses a dispossessed and desperate <i>woman</i> as a political tool. To 
            me, this reading of the book re-emphasizes the significance of all forms of oppression; it reminds us that only by uniting 
            against all forms of hierarchy can all people truly be free.

        <h2>Top 5 Blindness Metaphors in <i>Invisible Man</i></h2>
        <img src="images/Invisible_Man_Cover.jpg" alt="An image of the cover of Invisible Man" style="width:234px;height:362x;">
        <p>Here’s a fun thing you might not have caught in your reading of <i>Invisible Man</i>: Obviously it focuses a lot on the notion 
            of “invisibility,” but it also talks more than you’d expect about blindness. Different people are blind in different ways 
            that inform the way they behave. Here’s the top 5 ways <i>Invisible Man</i> uses blindness as a metaphor. Number 4 will shock you!
            <ol>
                <li>
                    This is a pretty obvious one, but an important one nonetheless: Rev. Homer A. Barbee, the most eloquent defender of 
                    the Booker T. Washington model of Black emancipation, is revealed to be blind at the end of his speech. This symbolizes 
                    that although he firmly believes what he says, he cannot see the world and check for evidence. To believe in this 
                    simplistic model requires one to ignore all that can be seen with the naked eye.
                </li>
                <li>
                    On a related note: Brother Jack is, later in the story, revealed to have a glass eye. The Brotherhood is not blind; 
                    it notices the inequalities in society and acts to resist them. However, it only sees half of the truth. It ignores 
                    the effects of gender, race, and personal history on a person’s motivations. In making their worldview so ‘scientific’ 
                    and theoretical, they are unable to conceptualize the people they deal with as individuals. Their worldview treats all 
                    actors as two-dimensional; it lacks depth, just like someone with only one eye.
                </li>

                    When presenting for the first time in front of an audience, the narrator addresses the crowd in very familiar terms. He describes to the reader that they are compassionate and want him to succeed, despite the fact that the spotlight on him is so blinding he cannot actually see any of them. He says that while he was speaking, he felt possessed by the words, and upon greater inspection, didn’t actually completely understand what he had said. Additionally, after his speech is delivered, he stumbles and falls back to his seat in a way similar to Barbee. We are left to wonder whether there was a real difference between him and Barbee or if what he said was just more blind nonsense. Ellison, by juxtaposing this speech with the real community-organizing work the protagonist later does in Harlem, may be telling the reader that the work of improving the world must be done in the streets and not in an amphitheater. Even a capable leader is too blind to understand and put into words The Whole Truth.

                    The repeated conflict between black members of the Brotherhood and the followers of Ras the exhorter are predicted by the main character without his knowledge. During his aforementioned blind speech, the protagonist says “Up to now we've been like a couple of one-eyed men walking down opposite sides of the street. Someone starts throwing bricks and we start blaming each other and fighting among ourselves. But we're mistaken! Because there's a third party present. There's a smooth, oily scoundrel running down the middle of the wide gray street throwing stones -- He's the one! He's doing the damage!” When regarding the condition of poor black people, the Brothers ignore race, and Ras’s followers ignore class. They are each half-blind, and though they have a common goal of the liberation of poor and black people, they fight one another to the advantage of the ruling class.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The metaphor of blindness is connected to the metaphor of invisibility. This is directly addressed in the prologue. When describing the man that he beat up for insulting him, he says “Poor fool, poor <b>blind</b> fool, I thought with sincere compassion, mugged by an <b>invisible</b> man!” There are two ways for one not to be seen: either the subject is invisible, or the viewer is blind. This connection of blindness with invisibility acts as an important through-line to understanding the plot. If we view blindness as a metaphor for restrictive worldviews that keep you from engaging with the world as it really is, then the main conceit of the book is incomplete. The fact that most whites are too prejudiced to consider the protagonist as a 3-dimensional human has more to do with their blindness than his invisibility.
