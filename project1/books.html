        <h2>Invisible Woman: Feminism and Sexuality in <i>Invisible Man</i></h2>
        <p>One of the most interesting characters in Invisible Man to me is Sybil. She appears in only a single scene, and has no 
            large effect on the plot, but her characterization (especially compared to the other sexualized white women in the book) 
            is surprisingly deep.<br>
            On first glance, she appears no different from the other nameless white woman that the protagonist gets into bed with. 
            Both seem to want him only as a sexual object and Sybil, if anything, is worse due to her desire not just for sex, but 
            specifically to be raped. However, consider the way she talks about the protagonist in relation to herself: When asked 
            about why she would tell him about such a taboo desire, she replies “Oh, I know that I can trust you. I just knew you'd 
            understand; you're not like other men. We're kind of alike.” and later continues “you are [so sensitive], and I feel so 
            free with you. You've no idea.” (p. 520). One does not get the sense that she views him only as a sexually aggressive 
            black man, but as a tender bedmate and partner with whom she can entrust a secret desire. The protagonist’s comment that 
            she thinks he is a “domesticated rapist” (p. 521), while it may fit our preconceptions of her motives, doesn’t really fit 
            with what she says or does.<br>
            Instead, I think Sybil is better read as a commentary on women’s and sexual liberation. Due to her condition as the wife 
            of an important man, she has little autonomy or adventure in her life. She says on page 521 that “I get so tired of living 
            the way I do, […] Soon I’ll be old and nothing will’ve happened to me. […] [my husband] talks a lot about women’s rights, 
            but what does he know about what a woman needs?” She feels that although her husband has an orthodox doctrine on women’s 
            rights, he does not care about her wants or needs as an individual. Having no other outlet for the lack of meaning in her 
            patriarchally-dominated life, she pursues sex as an escape. Her taboo desires are not born out of a racist view of black 
            men, but because (in her words) “Men have repressed [women] too much. We’re expected to pass up too many human things” 
            (519). Her inability to have her needs met inside of her marriage causes her to develop potentially unhealthy and inflated 
            desires. This, however, does not correlate to a dehumanizing view of the protagonist. After he tricks her into believing 
            he had done what she asked, she is giddy and grateful; happy that she has found someone who (she thinks) sees her, wants 
            her, and cares about her emotional and sexual needs. Although she still lacks autonomy over her life, she is at least 
            content to have some control over her sexuality. This happiness is cut short, however. The protagonist realizes she cannot 
            help him with his political ambitions, and as he has no desire to know her as a person, he takes the opportunity given to 
            him by the riot to abandon her forever.<br>
            By the end of the book the protagonist has recognized his invisibility and decided to make the most of it, however, this 
            does not make him enlightened. Sybil is as invisible to him as he is to Jack or any of the others. Her interests and 
            desires are not comprehended but stereotyped. Her identity is not that of an equal but that of a pitiable whore. I don’t 
            know whether Ellison intended his work to have any feminist reading, but to me, this scene serves to remind us that nobody 
            can see everything. Even as the protagonist can comprehend several axes of oppression, he is still blind to others, in 
            this case gender and sexuality. To get back at white people for using dispossessed and desperate black people as a 
            political tool, the protagonist, a man, uses a dispossessed and desperate woman as a political tool. To me, this reading 
            of the book re-emphasizes the significance of all forms of oppression; it reminds us that only by uniting against all 
            forms of hierarchy can all people truly be free.</p>
